## Listeners

You'll likely spend a lot of time laying out your components inside of panels and frames. If you're a perfectionist like me, you'll want everything exactly in its place. That's all well and good, but looks aren't everything. Our users are going to want to interact with our interfaces. There are a number of listeners that allow our GUI components to respond to certain actions a user might take.

## Action Listeners

An action listener is one of the most common event handlers you'll need to implement. We use action listeners to define how our program should respond when a user performs an action, such as clicking a button, choosing a menu item, or selection a checkbox or radio button.

Whenever the user performs an action, Java sends out what is called an `actionPerformed` message. Any action listeners registered with the component can then respond to the action. Let's use a simple button click as an example.
