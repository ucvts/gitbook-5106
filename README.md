# Course Syllabus

## Course Description

Advanced Software Development introduces students to engineering, programming, and business concepts critical to the design, implementation, and production of commercial-grade software. Fundamental topics in this course include essential data structures, best practice programming principles, building graphical applications, integrating databases, and deploying multitiered desktop and web applications. The course emphasizes the software development lifecycle, as well as the integration of multiple programming languages, tools, and technologies. This is a project-based course, with a heavy focus on programming assignments and presentations.

## Topic Outline

This course is comprised of six units of instruction.

* Data Structures
* Graphical Applications
* Persisting the Data
* Enterprise Applications
* Software Development Lifecycle
* Meteor

## Required Texts

While it isn't necessary to read any of these texts from cover to cover, we'll be referencing them in the earlier portion of this course.

* _Core Java: Volume I—Fundamentals_
* _Core Java: Volume II—Advanced Features_
* _Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java_
* _Effective Java_

They are available in PDF format, and can be downloaded on Canvas.

## Grading Policy

Marking period grades are comprised of tests, quizzes, and programming assignments.

* Problem Sets \(up to 75 points\)
* Projects \(up to 300 points\)

This course is entirely project-based. You'll create fully functional applications, and present those applications as if you were trying to sell them. There will be no tests or quizzes.

## Late Policy

The world is full of deadlines, and you need to learn to prioritize and manage your time accordingly. For assignments without a presentational component, there will be a 10% daily penalty levied against all late submissions. After the ninth day, submissions will not longer be accepted. If you are scheduled to present an application, it's all-or-none. If you're not ready to present on your scheduled day and time, you'll receive a zero for the presentational component of the assignment \(though you can still submit the code itself for partial credit, per the above guidelines\).

## Attendance Policy

All assignments are distributed and submitted electronically. Absence from class, without documented extenuating circumstances, does not excuse your failure to complete and submit assignments on time. If you are absent for a scheduled presentation, you will be expected to present it the very next time you are in class.

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to complete assignments independently. Using code that is not your own, whether it is that of a classmate or a third-party source, is not permissible unless explicitly noted in writing. Failure to abide by these conditions results in a zero for the assignment. No exceptions. Please be sure you have read your school's Honor Code and that you understand the consequences of violating it.
