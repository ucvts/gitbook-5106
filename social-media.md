# Social Media

## Summary

We've had a bit of practice creating and debugging web applications, but so far we haven't strayed too far from the tutorial projects. [Inventory Management](inventory-management.md) was essentially a rehashing of the [UCVTS Library](ucvts-library.md). Now, you're going to get a chance to create something new and different!

We're going to build our own social media profiles. While it would be cool to recreate something like Facebook, we're not quite there yet! We're going to start off small and build only the profile section of a typical social media platform.

## Requirements

Think of something like Facebook or LinkedIn or some other social media platform you know and love. Typically, there's a section where you can customize your profile â€” add a profile picture, birthday, where you're from, where you go to school, that sort of thing.

You're free to style and layout your profile section as you see fit, but it should support the following information and functionality.

* Provide login and logout functionality.
* Display the following personal information for the logged in user.
  * First and last name
  * College or university
  * High school
  * Hometown
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Phone number
* Allow user's to modify their personal information.
* Allow users to upload a profile picture \(if multiple pictures are uploaded, only the most recent needs to be retained and displayed\).
* Display the last date and time the user logged into their profile.
* Display the last date and time the user modified their profile.
* All information should be visible to anyone, but only editable by the logged in user.

## Nice-to-Haves

In software, a nice-to-have is something that isn't a requirement to go to market, but would be...nice to have! Consider these extra credit for the assignment, but only if done well. Poorly implemented nice-to-haves can negatively impact an application \(and your grade!\).

* Allow users to set certain pieces of information as hidden from public view.
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Phone number
* Retain all of the user's profile pictures, allowing user's to select the image to use.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.
2. Submit a video demo for the application + optional extra credit \(between 3 and 5 minutes\).

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Wednesday, March 3, 2021.
