# Data Definition

## Working with Databases

One of the biggest concerns in software development is data. It sparks a number of questions that need to be considered in the planning and design stages of a project.

* How much data will our application process?
* What will the types and formats of the data be?
* How and where should we store this data?

Enter, databases. Just about every application you use today has one \(or many\), from games you play online to apps you use on your phone or tablet. When we think about interacting with databases, we break down the means of communication into two primary languages.

* Data definition language \(DDL\), which is used to create or alter the structure of a database.
* Data manipulation language \(DML\), which is used to modify the contents of a database.

We're going to start with DDL before jumping into connecting to and manipulating a database.

## Relational Model

There are a number of different models of databases in use today. We're going to work with a traditional relational database. In this model, the database contains tables that represent an entity in your application. Each table, in turn, stores rows corresponding to individual records.

Let's start with a simple example.

## Create

Create statements are where it all begins. You need to create a database, and then create tables in that database before you can do anything else.

## Alter



## Drop
