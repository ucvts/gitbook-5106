## Overview

A queue is nothing more than a line you might wait in at the store. You enter the line at the back, and you exit the line when you reach the front. Remember stacks? They operated one a LIFO \(last-in-first-out\) system. Well, queues work the other way around. It's a first-in-first-out \(FIFO\) system.
