## Overview

Queues are nothing more than a line you might wait in at the store. You enter the line at the back, and you exit the line when you reach the front. Remember stacks? They operated one a LIFO \(last-in-first-out\) system. Well, queues work the other way around. It's a first-in-first-out \(FIFO\) system.

## Implementations

There are few different types of queues, namely an `AbstractQueue` and a `PriorityQueue`. An `AbstractQueue` behaves exactly as you might expect, and that's what we'll focus on.

### PriorityQueue

A `PriorityQueue` is pretty simple. It functions just like a line with a few notable exceptions. You can add elements to the back of the queue, and remove elements from the front of it. There is a priority system that allows certain elements in the queue to have a higher value \(and therefore get to the front of the line more quickly\), but we're going to ignore that for now.

The operations it provides are pretty simple. Let's take a look.

#### Constructors

There are a lot of ways \(seven, actually\) to create a `PriorityQueue`. We're going to focus on just a few.

* `PriorityQueue()`
* `PriorityQueue(int initialCapacity)`
* `PriorityQueue(List<String> list)`

As you might've guessed, this creates an empty queue. You can read more about it in [the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/AbstractQueue.html).

#### Methods

There aren't many operations to cover. The functionality isn't all that complex, either.

* `add(E e)`
* `clear()`
* `comparator()`
* `contains(Object o)`
* `element()`
* `offer(E e)`
* `peek()`
* `poll()`
* `remove()`
* `remove(Object o)`

See? Simple. Most of these are pretty self-explanation, and are [well-documented](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/AbstractQueue.html). Time to implement our own queue!
