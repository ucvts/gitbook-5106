# Problem Set 2

## **Summary**

Implement a simplified, but working version of the `HashSet` class without using built-in Java library classes.

## Requirements

1. Create a new repository called `pset-2`.
2. Implement a simplified, but working version of the `HashSet` class.
3. Add, commit, and push your code to the `pset-2` repository.

## Specifications

Your code must adhere to the following specifications.

### HashSet

1. Implement a simplified, but working version of the `HashSet` class called `SimpleHashSet` capable only of storing `String` objects.
2. You are prohibited from using any Java library classes other than `String`.
3. You must implement the following constructors, some of which have been modified to adhere to the simplification of only storing `String` objects.
   * `SimpleHashSet()`
   * `SimpleHashSet(int initialCapacity)`
   * `SimpleHashSet(Collection<String> c)`
4. You must implement the following methods, some of which have been modified to adhere to the simplification of only storing `String` objects.
   * `add(String s)`
   * `clear()`
   * `contains(String s)`
   * `isEmpty()`
   * `remove(String s)`
   * `size()`
5. Your `SimpleHashSet` class should behave exactly as the built-in `HashSet` class does.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your repository URL.

Your implementation must behave identically to the built-in Java library class on which it is based.

## Deadline

All submissions are due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Sunday, September 27, 2020.
